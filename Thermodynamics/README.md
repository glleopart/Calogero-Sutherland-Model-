# Thermodynamic Properties

Purpose
- Store figures, notebooks, scripts and raw data related to thermodynamic properties (free energy, entropy, specific heat, etc.).

Suggested files
- `free_energy.png` — main figure for free energy vs temperature.
- `specific_heat.png` — specific heat vs temperature.
- `thermo_analysis.ipynb` — notebook with thermodynamic calculations and plots.

Referencing images from the main file
- Use relative links from the repository root, e.g.:
  - `![Free energy](Thermodynamic Properties/free_energy.png)`

Best practices
- Add a short caption and the generation command or notebook cell number for reproducibility.
- Keep raw data in `*.csv` or `*.npy` alongside notebooks.
