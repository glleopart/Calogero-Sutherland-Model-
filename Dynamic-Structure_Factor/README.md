# Dynamic Structure Factor

Purpose
- Store figures, notebooks, scripts and raw data related to the dynamic structure factor (DSF).

Suggested files
- `dsf_plot.png` — main figure to display on the front page.
- `dsf_calculation.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook that produces DSF plots.
- `dsf_data.csv` — raw numeric data used to create the plots.

Referencing images from the main file
- Use relative links from the repository root, e.g.:
  - `![DSF plot](Dynamic Structure Factor/dsf_plot.png)`

Best practices
- Include brief captions in this README for each figure (so the front page can reference them cleanly).
- Use consistent numeric formats for filenames (e.g. `T=0.5_q=1.0.png`).
