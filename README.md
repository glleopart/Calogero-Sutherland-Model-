# Calogero–Sutherland Model — Main

This repository collects calculations, figures and notebooks for the Calogero–Sutherland model used in the project.

Main purpose
- Present the project overview and the main results (figures and short descriptions).
- Serve as the compiled front page of the repository (this Markdown file is the repository's front page on GitHub).

Main results (short summary / placeholders)
- Result A — short, one-line statement of main analytic/numeric result.
- Result B — short, one-line statement of secondary result.

Cover figures and visual summary
- Key figures should be added to the folders below and referenced here using relative links, for example:
  - `![DSF example](Dynamic Structure Factor/dsf_plot.png)`
  - `![Free energy example](Thermodynamic Properties/free_energy.png)`

Repository structure
- `README.md` — this front page and entry point.
- `Dynamic Structure Factor/` — figures, notebooks and data for dynamic structure factor (DSF).
- `Thermodynamic Properties/` — figures, notebooks and data for thermodynamic quantities.

How to use this front page
- Add image files (PNG, SVG, PDF) into the appropriate subfolder.
- Reference them above using the relative paths shown.
- If you want a PDF front page instead, replace this file with `Main.tex` and add build instructions.

Adding content
- Place notebooks, scripts and raw data inside the relevant subfolder.
- Keep figure filenames descriptive (e.g. `dsf_q1_w2.png`, `free_energy_T05.png`).
